# Power-control-by-IR-remote

## Overview

This project simulates and analyzes the wireless control of a load as part of the Electronics II course at the German International University. The work includes deriving the concepts, implementing them in Proteus Software and Microchip Studio, testing system behavior under various conditions, and constructing the circuit on a breadboard.
