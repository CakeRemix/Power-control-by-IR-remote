# Power-control-by-IR-remote

## Overview

This project simulates and analyzes the wireless control of a load as part of the Electronics II course at the German International University. The work includes deriving the concepts, implementing them in Ltspice Software, testing system behavior under various conditions, and constructing the circuit on a breadboard.

## Contents

- Hardware pictures and schematics of the circuit
- Ltspice simulation of the system
- Graphs and performance analysis
- [Project report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19k3RAX1upicZQ6JkpAsMRenQnKo7MZmX/view?usp=sharing)

## How to Run

1. Open Ltspice Software.
2. Load the source files.
3. Load the libraries needed
4. Run the simulation to view the system in motion.
5. Report can be opened with any PDF viewer.

## Requirements

- Ltspice (any recent version)
- Intermediate understanding of electronics circuits and Signal Processing
